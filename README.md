# LIRI-Bot
 LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

 Usage: node liri-bot.js Request [request parameter]'

 Valid requests:
   1) 'my-tweets'
   2) 'spotify-this-song' \<song name>
   3) 'movie-this' \<movie name>
   4) 'do-what-it-says' [filename]   defaults to ./random.text'

   This app has reasonable error handling
